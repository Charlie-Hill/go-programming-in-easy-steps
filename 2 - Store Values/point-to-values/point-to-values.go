	Whenever your program creates a container to store data, your computer allocates a space in memory at which to store the data
	An initialised variable consists of three parts
		- Name					"num"
		- Value					20
		- Memory Address		0x00009e068


	Go program supports the concept of "pointers" - a pointer can store the address of another variable & access the value stored at that address
